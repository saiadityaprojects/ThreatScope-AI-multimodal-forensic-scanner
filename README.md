## 📖 Project Overview
ThreatScope AI is a cybersecurity forensic dashboard designed to bridge the gap between victim safety and technical investigation. Unlike standard scanners that only look at text, ThreatScope uses **Multimodal AI** to analyze:
* **Emails & Text:** Header analysis, SPF/DKIM verification, and intent detection.
* **Documents (PDF/Office):** Scanning for suspicious macros and embedded scripts.
* **Audio (MP3):** Vishing (Voice Phishing) detection to flag urgency and fake authority in voice notes.

The application features a unique **Dual-Mode Interface**:
1.  **Civilian Mode:** Simplified, jargon-free actionable advice for victims.
2.  **SOC Analyst Mode:** Deep technical forensics including IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and IP Geolocation.
